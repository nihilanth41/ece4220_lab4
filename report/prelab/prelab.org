** Realtime fifos 
Include rtai_fifos.h

- int rtf_create(unsigned int minor, int size)
  - minor: positive int less than RTF_NO. Identifies the fifo.
  - size: size of the fifo, can resize existing ones. (bytes? doesn't specify) 
  - returns 0 on success; ENODEV or ENOMEM on failure.

- int rtf_destroy(unsigned int minor)
  - minor: identifier
  - Needs to be called as many times as rtf_create(). 
  - Returns non-negative value on success - the number of fifos that still need closed
  - Returns negative value on failure - ENODEV or EINVAL

- int rtf_get(unsigned int minor, void *buf, int count)
  - minor: identifier
  - buf: pointer to buffer 
  - count: size of buffer in bytes
  - Returns size of the received block on success; ENODEV or EINVAL on failure.

- int rtf_put(unsigned int minor, void *buf, int count)
  - Essentially the same usage as rtf_get()
** Userspace semaphore 
For all functions:
Include semaphore.h and link with -lpthread.
Returns 0 on success, -1 on error (and sets errno).

- int sem_init(sem_t *sem, int pshared, unsigned int value)
  - sem: Pointer to sem_t to be initalized.
  - phared: 0 for sharing between threads only. Nonzero for sharing between processes.
  - value: value to initialize to (i.e. number of non-blocking calls to sem_wait() )
    
- int sem_wait(sem_t *sem)
 - Decrements (locks) the semaphore pointed to by sem. Returns immediately if semaphore value is greater than 0, else blocks.

- int sem_destroy(sem_t *sem)
 - Destroys the semaphore

- int sem_post(sem_t *sem)
 - Increments (unlocks) the semaphore
